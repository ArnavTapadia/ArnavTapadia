# Hi, Iâ€™m Arnav Tapadia ðŸ‘‹
I'm a senior at Cornell University majoring in **Applied and Engineering Physics** with minors in **Data Science** and **Business**. Iâ€™m passionate about applying machine learning to solve **real-world problems**, particularly in **AI safety** and **time-series forecasting** and **physics modeling**. My background in physics gives me a unique perspective in modeling complex systems, while my data science expertise helps me develop robust ML solutions.

## ðŸ”­ What I'm Working On
Iâ€™m currently focused on improving **AI alignment** by creating models that predict human emotions using emotion data and chat logs with large language models (LLMs). This research aims to make AI systems more empathetic and aligned with human intentions.

## ðŸ’» Featured Projects
1. **AI Alignment Research Notebooks**  
   Developing models to predict human emotions based on interactions with LLMs. This project also explores time-series forecasting methods to model emotion patterns over time.  
   Techniques used include **data imputation**, **deep learning**, and **recursive time-series forecasting**.

3. **Half-Car Model for Cornell Baja Racing**  
   Simulation models built in Simulink to analyze vehicle dynamics and performance, specifically focusing on suspension system behavior and lap-time sensitivity.  
   Includes Simulink model as well as MATLAB scripts for **suspension studies** and data analysis scripts to improve vehicle design for off-road racing.

5. **App for Managing Purchases and Expenditures**  
   An app developed to manage household purchases and expenditures using a database to record transactions. It allows users to take a photo of a receipt, which is processed through **OCR technology** to update the database automatically.  
   Coded in **Xcode using Swift** with a graphical user interface using Swift UI and integration with Firebase and REST APIs.

6. **F1 Car Speed Prediction Model**  
   A personal project I am working on when I have the time that summarizes and compares different ML models I've learned through the ML class at Cornell to predict the speed of an F1 car based on track geometry.
